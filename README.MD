### Simple values

Simple values start with a lower case letter. 

```
a
alpha
```

_Note: They must NOT start with an `_`_

### Lists

Lists get denoted by their elements enclosed in `[]`

```
[a, b, c]
```

You can also denote lists by combining head and tail separated by `|`. These must still be enclosed in `[]`

```
[X|XS]
```
